# EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144) ‚Äì Educational Documentation

## üìå Introduction
EternalBlue is the codename for a cyberattack exploit developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).  
It takes advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft‚Äôs Server Message Block (SMBv1) protocol on Windows systems, including **Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008**.  

The exploit was leaked by the group **Shadow Brokers** in April 2017 and later weaponized in major global attacks such as **WannaCry** and **NotPetya**.  

This repository is created **strictly for educational and research purposes** to help cybersecurity students understand the impact of EternalBlue, its history, and the mitigation techniques.

## üîé Vulnerability Details
- **CVE ID:** [CVE-2017-0144](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-0144)  
- **Affected Protocol:** Microsoft SMBv1  
- **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE)  
- **Affected Systems:** Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and others  

EternalBlue exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft‚Äôs SMBv1 protocol. This allowed attackers to remotely execute code on a target machine without authentication.
